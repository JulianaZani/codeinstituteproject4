# Volunteer Testimonials - HopeBridge Community

**Volunteer Testimonials** is a full-stack web application built with Django. It allows users to share and read real-life stories about their experiences participating in social and volunteering projects. The name **HopeBridge Community** was not chosen at the beginning of the project.

The site is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind, following modern development practices using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.  

**Project Journey**  
This project was a real challenge for me. For most of the post-third project period, I had to work longer hours at my job, which left me with very limited time to study. It was only towards the end that my workload at the company decreased, allowing me to dedicate more time to completing the project. There were many moments when I almost gave up. Thank you, and I apologize for any rough edges!

## Credits
[â–² Back to Top](#volunteer-testimonials---hopebridge-community)

All of Code Institute's classes (from the beginning to the present) have been the foundation of my learning (although I completely forgot about the Django AllAuth classes and did so much manually).
I conducted research using: chatGPT, YouTube, Google, and GitHub.
The content of the testimonials was created by me based on my experiences with some social activities I engaged in throughout my life while living in Brazil.
I found the images on Google Images (I chose the Creative Commons licensed search engine) to complement the testimonials:
