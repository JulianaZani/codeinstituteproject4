# Volunteer Testimonials - HopeBridge Community

**Volunteer Testimonials** is a full-stack web application built with Django. It allows users to share and read real-life stories about their experiences participating in social and volunteering projects. The name **HopeBridge Community** was not chosen at the beginning of the project.

The site is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind, following modern development practices using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.    
The project is available online at:  
[https://testimonials-aeb7081fc7ea.herokuapp.com/](https://testimonials-aeb7081fc7ea.herokuapp.com/)  

**Project Journey**  
This project was a real challenge for me. For most of the post-third project period, I had to work longer hours at my job, which left me with very limited time to study. It was only towards the end that my workload at the company decreased, allowing me to dedicate more time to completing the project. There were many moments when I almost gave up. Thank you, and I apologize for any rough edges!

## CRUD Functionality  
[â–² Back to Top](#volunteer-testimonials---hopebridge-community) 

The project implements full CRUD functionality for testimonials:  

**Create** â€“ Users can submit a new testimonial in "Submit Testimonial".  

![submittestimonial](doc/screenshots/crud00.png)  

After the user submits a testimonial, the following message appears:  

![submittestimonialmsg](doc/screenshots/crud01.png)  


**Read** â€“ All testimonials are displayed on the homepage for users to view.  

![testimonials](doc/screenshots/crud02.png) 

The user can then access their own testimony, and the edit and delete buttons appear.  

**Update** â€“ Logged-in users can edit their testimonials via the "Edit" button.  

After editing the statement, just click submit.  

![edit](doc/screenshots/crud03.png)  

After submitting the statement, a message will appear informing you that the edited statement will have to wait for the administrator's approval.  

![editmsg](doc/screenshots/crud04.png)  


**Delete** â€“ Logged-in users can delete a testimonial they created.  

Instead of clicking edit, the user clicks delete and a page opens asking if the user really wants to delete.

![deletequestion](doc/screenshots/crud05.png)  

After delete confirmation a delete confirmation message appears.

This project follows good security practices to protect passwords, tokens, and secret keys:  

- Environment Variables (.env)  

Sensitive information, such as:  
Django's SECRET_KEY  
DATABASE_URL  
CLOUDINARY_URL  

These are stored in an .env file, which is not committed to Git.

- .gitignore  

The .env file is listed in .gitignore, ensuring that it is not committed to the public repository.  

- Secure Variable Loading  

During local development, variables are loaded via env.py.  

In production (Heroku), these variables are defined in the platform's environment variables panel.

## Bugs
[â–² Back to Top](#volunteer-testimonials---hopebridge-community)

In addition to the issues resolved and presented in the README development, I also encountered these:  
- Error 500 (Internal Server Error). I added the TestimonialForm to forms.py and it finally worked.
- When trying to log in: Page not found (404). I hadn't set LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL in the settings.
- When logging in, writing the testimonial, choosing the image, and clicking submit, I got this error: ValueError: Must supply api_key. I adjusted the cloudinary.config in settings.py and CLOUDINARY_URL in Heroku, and the site was able to accept testimonials with images.
- Error: Syntax problem in the template (testimonial_detail.html). I fixed the syntax by removing the parentheses that were there incorrectly, and it worked again.

## Credits
[â–² Back to Top](#volunteer-testimonials---hopebridge-community)

- All of Code Institute's classes (from the beginning to the present) have been the foundation of my learning (although I completely forgot about the Django AllAuth classes and did so much manually).
- I conducted research using: chatGPT, YouTube, Google, GitHub and Copilot.
- The content of the testimonials was created by me based on my experiences with some social activities I engaged in throughout my life while living in Brazil.
- I found the images on Google Images (I chose the Creative Commons licensed search engine) to complement the testimonials:
